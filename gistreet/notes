After spending tens of hours tring to get the image to render on the product details page, it was finally a case of removing many=True in the ProductSerializer imported method. seems like the many=true flag was turning the img into a list object and the browser couldnt render it.

The same flag is needed to render the latestproducslist, without it the images arent seen. doesnt make sense that the productdetail method would need it. 
removing it on productdetail param worked.

getting 500 server error, path doesnt exist, when creating catagory view. 
the url is showing as catagory/catagory which needsto be changed anyways because of bad UX. 
ill  tinker with the admin/views/url file.
because category slug is same as name?
something inside sql database?
GET method in catagoryDetail class not finding which collumn or row in db.
changed axios route in catagory vue, 404
changed exception in catdetail class in view, 404
debug output is cat object with slug of mens not found in db.
changed name of cat in database to MensWear, still 404
its not because its lowercase is it
yes it was. lesson learned.
