After spending tens of hours tring to get the image to render on the product details page, it was finally a case of removing many=True in the ProductSerializer imported method. seems like the many=true flag was turning the img into a list object and the browser couldnt render it.

The same flag is needed to render the latestproducslist, without it the images arent seen. doesnt make sense that the productdetail method would need it. 
removing it on productdetail param worked.
